# Moments of quadratic ratios

This package implements formulas to obtain the moments of quadratic ratios
or normal random variables.

This group of functions provides several functionalities
to analytically calculate first and second moments of different
distributions. Mainly, utilities for ratios of quadratic forms,
inverse non-central chi squared distribution, and inverse
non-central chi distribution are provided.
